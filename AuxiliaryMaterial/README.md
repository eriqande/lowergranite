## Supporting info for the paper

The .r files are representative of pooled and stratified comparisons for bootstrap and asymptotic normal estimators and confidence intervals.  It may be useful to put them out there as an illustration of the current code.

The TeX file updates the simulation inputs table.

The excel files contain the simulation outputs--one for bias and one (with two tabs) for coverage.
